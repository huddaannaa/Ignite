**Usage:**  
This file is used to provide reusable functions that can be called from other parts of the application.

```python
import func
result = func.some_utility_function()
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- Check the function definitions and ensure they are correctly implemented.
- Verify the inputs to each function are valid and as expected.

### 5. `ignite.py`

**Purpose:**  
Handles the initialization and ignition of the main application components.

**Contents:**
- **start()**: Function to initialize and start the application.
- **setup()**: Function to set up necessary configurations before starting the application.

**Key Functions:**
- `start()`: Initializes and starts the main components of the application.
- `setup(config)`: Prepares the application using the provided configuration.

**Usage:**  
This file is used to kickstart the application, ensuring all necessary components are initialized.

```python
import ignite
ignite.start()
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure all configurations are correctly set up before calling `start()`.
- Check for any initialization errors in the log files.

### 6. `kh.ico`

**Purpose:**  
Icon file used within the application for UI/UX purposes.

**Contents:**
- **Icon Graphic**: The image data for the icon.

**Usage:**  
Referenced in the applicationâ€™s UI components for branding and visual representation.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure the file path is correct when referencing the icon.
- Verify the icon format is supported by the UI framework.

### 7. `libs.py`

**Purpose:**  
Manages external library imports and dependency management.

**Contents:**
- **Library Imports**: Import statements for external libraries.
- **Dependency Initialization**: Functions to initialize and configure external libraries.

**Key Functions:**
- `initialize_dependencies()`: Sets up and configures external libraries required by the application.

**Usage:**  
This file is used to manage and initialize third-party libraries and dependencies.

```python
import libs
libs.initialize_dependencies()
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure all necessary libraries are installed in the environment.
- Check for compatibility issues between different library versions.

### 8. `params.py`

**Purpose:**  
Defines and manages application parameters and configurations.

**Contents:**
- **Parameter Definitions**: Key-value pairs for various application settings.
- **Configuration Management**: Logic to read and manage configurations.

**Key Functions:**
- `get_config()`: Reads configuration parameters from a file or environment variables.
- `set_param(key, value)`: Sets a specific configuration parameter.

**Usage:**  
This file is used to handle application settings and configurations.

```python
import params
config = params.get_config()
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure the configuration file exists and is correctly formatted.
- Verify the values of critical parameters before starting the application.

### 9. `parcer.conf`

**Purpose:**  
Configuration file for the parser component of the application.

**Contents:**
- **Parser Settings**: Key-value pairs for parser-specific configurations.

**Usage:**  
Referenced internally by the parser module for configuration settings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python and all necessary dependencies installed. You can install required libraries using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

1. **Initialize Components:**  
   Start by initializing the necessary components using `ignite.py`.

   ```python
   import ignite
   ignite.start()
   ```

2. **Parse Arguments:**  
   Use `args.py` to parse any command-line arguments needed for the application.

   ```python
   import args
   parsed_args = args.parse_arguments()
   ```

3. **Load Configuration:**  
   Load configurations using `params.py`.

   ```python
   import params
   config = params.get_config()
   ```

4. **Start Main Functionality:**  
   Invoke the main functionalities as required by your specific use case.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Missing Configuration Files:**
  Ensure all configuration files (`settings.ini`, `parcer.conf`) are present in the expected directories.

- **Invalid Arguments:**
  Verify that the command-line arguments provided are correct and match the expected format.

- **Dependency Issues:**
  Ensure all required libraries are installed and compatible. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

- **Database Errors:**
  Check the integrity of the `fields.db` file and ensure the schema matches the application's expectations.

### Logs

Check log files for detailed error messages and stack traces. Logs are usually located in the `logs` directory.
